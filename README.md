# JustCater

I chose to do my first project for a family members business which I have been involved from the start. JustCater is a local artisan catering company located in the country side of Waterford. He had previously got a website done and was very unhappy with it. Since learning these new skills I decided to make a new website my self.


# UX

## Project Goals

The goal of JustCater is to provide a large range of catering functions for special occasions. JustCater has a broad range of target audiences with the most important been young couples and families for events such as weddings, communions and confirmations.

## Developer and Business Goals

Before I had started this project both me and the owner had a meeting and agreed upon the following goals of what we wanted to achieve as a developer and business owner. Which can be outlined below.

## User Stories

**As a business owner I want my customers to:**

* Be able to see the large range of services we cater for.

* Be able to view photos of our past events and dishes.

* Be able to contact us for events they would like us to cater for.

* Browse our menus.
 

**As a developer my goals are:**

* Create a project for my portfolio.

* Learn more about the technologies i have been studying and practising.

* For my client to be satisfied with my work and for it to drive more traffic to his business.

**As a customer of JustCater, I want:**

* To be able to view a website for JustCater.

* To be able to contact JustCater for an inquiry.

* See information about the company.

* To View past events JustCater have catered for.

* Browse sample menus for their selected event.


## Design Choices

The design of the website is easy and simple to navigate through. The following design choices were made with this in mind:

**Fonts**

* The font I used for the headings is the "Merriweather" font which I found appealing on the eye and which had a professional appeal about it.

* The font I used for my paragraphs is the "Oswald" font which I have used before and have seen many times and is a font in which people are accustomed to seeing.

**Icons**

* Icons were used for the social links as the icon is now more recognized than the brand name itself and users are used to seeing these icons and understand their meaning.

**Colors**

* The primary color is white. I chose to use white as the background color and using black as the font color as I wanted the images displayed on the page to be popped out. I wanted the images to catch the users attention upon visiting the page. The colors of black and white also work very well together and can be understood easy.

## Images

* I used the JustCater logo image on my navbar. I wanted the logo to be seen on every page visited on the site.

* On the home page of the website, I have a responsive image it is a picture of beautiful canapes. I used this image because of the quality and canapes also have a wedding appeal and it would capture viewers attention and also other catering company in this area doesn't offer food of the kind.

* Below the main home images, I have three menus offering different choices based on occasion. Each of these menus has an image that is used to describe them. I used these images as my CTA's to get the user to want to see more of what these menus offered and consisted of.

* On the gallery page I used 24 images each in a row of three (Desktop view) as odd numbers are more catching to the eye. The images are sized large and I used a variety of different types of pictures to show off what JustCater can offer.

## Styling and Structure

For the structure of the page, I wanted it simple and easy to navigate through for the user and from them to be able to get the information they were seeking.

* The navbar consists of the logo and a menu which offers there 3 pages available on the website: Home, Gallery and Contact. The logo and be clicked to return to the home page.

* The home page consists of our main image to grab the users attention.

* Under the image is a paragraph describing the company.

* Under the paragraph we have our call to actions which is our menus with an image representing the described menu and a downloadable link to the menus which opens in a separate tab.

* At the end of our pages is the footer which is a black color with white font color. It has the company phone number, email address and social links. These are clickable links to bring the provided action.

* The gallery page consists of images of past events, dishes and members of the team at work.

* The contact page consists of a paragraph asking the user to give information that the company would need for an inquiry. It is followed by a form for the user to submit for any enquiry they would like to make to JustCater.

## Wire Frames

The following documents are within my project in a folder labeled wireframes. There were made using Balsamiq during the Scope Plane part of the design and planning process for this project. The wireframes have changed from the start of the project to the end of it.

# Features

The main features of the site I wanted to focus on were the menus, gallery and the contact from.

1. The menus can be found under the a paragraph. The images of the menus are clickable and open in another tab. I used the images instead of writing, so the user can see what the food looks like on the menus. Menus open in another page, so the user can easily navigate from where they left off.

2. On the gallery page there is a short opening sentence followed by 24 images in a row of three. Images were picked to showcase the best of the company offerings. We wanted to show the quality of food, how we set up at functions and our team working at the functions.

3. The form was another important feature for it allowed the user to communicate directly with the company. The paragraph about the form was designed to get the basic information from the customer that the company need to estimate the overall project.

# Technologies Used

The languages used in the project were HTML and CSS. Other frameworks were used such as:

* [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) was used for my wireframes and sketches of my ideas.

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used as my framework and helped me with the responsive views on devices and also with the structuring of my website.

* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for my social media links located on the footer.
